This repository contains all the study and projects using this language that I did.

## Explanation

### There is any book for free?
Here there is not any book for free. I encourage you to use all of those that I did, because they helped me on my journey, and that is it.

### How can you navigate and understand
My solutions were build in a .go file and stored in each chapter folder of each book folder: My sugestion is to use as a helper, once it contains the answers of the exercises, at the same time the practice of the knowledge that I did.

At the time I learned the first concept I had already programmed many times, that is why my solutions can be a little more than the necessary. But, I am sure that for anyone won't be difficult.

## How do you run my solutions
First of all, make sure that in your terminal you are in the right place. For example, if you want to run a script that is on book1, chapter1, then write on your Linux terminal: 

$cd book1/chapter1$

Once you are on the right path.

$go run <main.go>$

Or

$go test <main.go>$

Done. Now you can see the answers printed in your terminal.
